My very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.

#### This __README.md__ file is intended as a *quick* reference and showcase for the **__project__**

##### [This link get you into this README.md file](https://github.com/horbenko/homepage/edit/master/README.md)

This project might consist two subprojects, but it is not sure:
1. Homepage :house:
  * might have some pages
  * might have images
2. Resume :bowtie:

The programing begins with
```java
public class HelloWorld {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
> Prints "Hello, World!" to the **terminal window**.
